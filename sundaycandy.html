    <h1>SUNDAY CANDY – CHANCE THE RAPPER – 2015</h1>
    <p>She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me<br>
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money<br>
I am the thesis of her prayers.<br>
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers,<br>
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor.<br>
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma<br>
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma!<br>
Mines is hand made, pan fried, sun dried<br>
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide.<br>
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club,<br>
Santa, something told me I should bring my butt to church!<br>
<br>
You gotta move it slowly,<br>
Take and eat my body like it's holy.<br>
I've been waiting for you for the whole week,<br>
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy.<br>
<br>
Come on in this house, 'cause it's gonna rain.<br>
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.<br>
You better come on in this house, 'cause it's gonna rain<br>
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.<br>
<br>
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth.<br>
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you.<br>
You look so good with a hat on, had to match with the shoes,<br>
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew.<br>
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate<br>
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place.<br>
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent<br>
You smell like, light, gas, water, electricity, rent<br>
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired<br>
And his praise is daily basis so I gotta try it.<br>
You're my dream catcher, dream team, team captain<br>
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute, lemme take my butt to church!<br>
<br>
You better come on in this house (come on in this house),<br>
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).<br>
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).<br>
You better come on in this house (come on in this house),<br>
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)<br>
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain.<br>
<br>
You gotta move it slowly,<br>
Take and eat my body like it's holy.<br>
I've been waiting for you for the whole week,<br>
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday, candy.<br>
<br>
Slowly. Take and eat my body like it's holy.<br>
I've been waiting for you for the whole week.<br>
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday, candy.<br>
<br>
You better come on in this house (come on in this house)<br>
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).<br>
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain<br>
You better come on in this house,<br>
'Cause it's gonna rain<br>
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.<br>
