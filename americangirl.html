    <h1>AMERICAN GIRL – TOM PETTY – 1976</h1>
    <p>Well, she was an American girl<br>
Raised on promises<br>
She couldn't help thinkin' that there<br>
Was a little more to life<br>
Somewhere else<br>
<br>
After all it was a great big world<br>
With lots of places to run to<br>
Yeah, and if she had to die tryin'<br>
She had one little promise<br>
She was gonna keep<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, alright<br>
Take it easy baby<br>
Make it last all night<br>
She was an American girl<br>
<br>
Well, it was kind of cold that night<br>
She stood alone on her balcony<br>
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by<br>
Out on 441<br>
Like waves crashin' on the beach<br>
<br>
And for one desperate moment there<br>
He crept back in her memory<br>
God it's so painful<br>
Something that's so close<br>
And still so far out of reach<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, alright<br>
Take it easy baby<br>
Make it last all night<br>
She was an American girl<br>
Ooh<br>
Ooh<br>
Ooh<br>
Oh yeah<br></p>
