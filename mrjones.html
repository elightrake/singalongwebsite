    <h1>MR. JONES – COUNTING CROWS – 1993</h1>
    <p>Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
Mmm<br>
Uh huh<br>
I was down at the New Amsterdam<br>
Staring at this yellow-haired girl<br>
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation<br>
With a black-haired flamenco dancer<br>
You know she dances while his father plays guitar<br>
She's suddenly beautiful<br>
And we all want something beautiful<br>
Man, I wish I was beautiful<br>
<br>
So come dance the silence down through the morning<br>
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah<br>
Uh huh, yeah<br>
Cut up, Maria<br>
Show me some of them Spanish dances<br>
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones<br>
Believe in me<br>
Help me believe in anything<br>
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
Mr. Jones and me<br>
Tell each other fairy tales<br>
And we stare at the beautiful women<br>
She's looking at you<br>
Ah, no, no, she's looking at me<br>
Smilin' in the bright lights<br>
Coming through in stereo<br>
When everybody loves you<br>
You can never be lonely<br>
<br>
Well, I'm gon' paint my picture<br>
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray<br>
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful<br>
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color<br>
I felt so symbolic yesterday<br>
If I knew Picasso<br>
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play<br>
<br>
Mr. Jones and me<br>
Looked into the future<br>
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women<br>
She's looking at you<br>
I don't think so<br>
She's looking at me<br>
Standing in the spotlight<br>
I bought myself a gray guitar<br>
When everybody loves me<br>
I will never be lonely<br>
<br>
I will never be lonely<br>
Said I'm never gonna be lonely<br>
I wanna be a lion<br>
Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats<br>
We all wanna be big, big stars<br>
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that<br>
Believe in me<br>
'Cause I don't believe in anything<br>
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
Mr. Jones and me<br>
Stumbling through the barrio<br>
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women<br>
She's perfect for you<br>
Man, there's got to be somebody for me<br>
I wanna be Bob Dylan<br>
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky<br>
When everybody loves you, ah son<br>
That's just about as funky as you can be<br>
<br>
Mr. Jones and me<br>
Staring at the video<br>
When I look at the television, I want to see me<br>
Staring right back at me<br>
We all wanna be big stars<br>
But we don't know why, and we don't know how<br>
But when everybody loves me<br>
I wanna be just about as happy as I can be<br>
Mr. Jones and me<br>
We're gonna be big stars<br>
