    <h1>OPERATOR - JIM CROCE - 1972</h1>
    <p>Operator, oh, could you help me place this call?<br>
        See the number on the matchbook is old and faded<br>
        She's living in L.A.<br>
        With my best old ex-friend, Ray<br>
        Guy, she said she knew well, and sometimes hated<br>
        But isn't that the way they say it goes?<br>
        Well, let's forget all that<br>
        And give me the number if you can find it<br>
        So, I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine<br>
        And to show I've overcome the blow<br>
        I've learned to take it well<br>
        I only wish my words could just convince myself<br>
        That it just wasn't real<br>
        But that's not the way it feels<br>
        <br>
        Operator, oh, could you help me place this call?<br>
        Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me<br>
        There's something in my eyes<br>
        You know it happens every time<br>
        I think about a love that I thought would save me<br>
        But isn't that the way they say it goes?<br>
        Well, let's forget all that<br>
        And give me the number if you can find it<br>
        So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine<br>
        And to show I've overcome the blow<br>
        I've learned to take it well<br>
        I only wish my words could just convince myself<br>
        That it just wasn't real<br>
        But that's not the way it feels, no, no, no, no<br>
        That's not the way it feels<br>
        <br>
        Operator, oh, let's forget about this call<br>
        There's no one there I really wanted to talk to<br>
        Thank you for your time<br>
        Ah, you've been so much more than kind<br>
        You can keep the dime<br>
        But isn't that the way they say it goes?<br>
        Well, let's forget all that<br>
        And give me the number if you can find it<br>
