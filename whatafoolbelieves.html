    <h1>WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES – MACDONALD/LOGGINS – 1979</h1>
    <p>He came from somewhere back in her long ago<br>
The sentimental fool don't see<br>
Tryin' hard to recreate<br>
What had yet to be created once in her life<br>
She musters a smile<br>
For his nostalgic tale<br>
Never coming near what he wanted to say<br>
Only to realize<br>
It never really was<br>
<br>
She had a place in his life<br>
He never made her think twice<br>
As he rises to her apology<br>
Anybody else would surely know<br>
He's watching her go<br>
<br>
But what a fool believes he sees<br>
No wise man has the power to reason away<br>
What seems to be<br>
Is always better than nothing<br>
And nothing at all keeps sending him...<br>
<br>
Somewhere back in her long ago<br>
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life<br>
Someday, somewhere, she will return<br>
<br>
She had a place in his life<br>
He never made her think twice<br>
As he rises to her apology<br>
Anybody else would surely know<br>
He's watching her go<br>
<br>
But what a fool believes he sees<br>
No wise man has the power to reason away<br>
What seems to be<br>
Is always better than nothing<br>
There's nothing at all<br>
But what a fool believes he sees...<br>
