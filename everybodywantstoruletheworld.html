    <h1>EVERYBODY WANTS TO RULE THE WORLD – TEARS FOR FEARS – 1985</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your life<br>
There's no turning back<br>
Even while we sleep<br>
We will find you<br>
<br>
Acting on your best behaviour<br>
Turn your back on mother nature<br>
Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
<br>
It's my own design<br>
It's my own remorse<br>
Help me to decide<br>
Help me make the most<br>
<br>
Of freedom and of pleasure<br>
Nothing ever lasts forever<br>
Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
<br>
There's a room where the light won't find you<br>
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down<br>
When they do I'll be right behind you<br>
<br>
So glad we've almost made it<br>
So sad they had to fade it<br>
Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
<br>
I can't stand this indecision<br>
Married with a lack of vision<br>
Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
Say that you'll never never never never need it<br>
One headline why believe it?<br>
Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
<br>
All for freedom and for pleasure<br>
Nothing ever lasts forever<br>
Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
<br>
