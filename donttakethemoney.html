    <h1>DON’T TAKE THE MONEY – BLEACHERS – 2017</h1>
    <p>Somebody broke me once<br>
Love was a currency<br>
A shimmering balance act<br>
I think that I laughed at that<br>
And I saw your face and hands<br>
Coloured in sun and then<br>
I think I understand<br>
Will I understand?<br>
<br>
Will we fight, stay up late?<br>
In my dreams I'm to blame<br>
Different sides of the bed<br>
Roll your eyes, shake my head<br>
Now we're stuck in the storm<br>
We were born to ignore<br>
And all I got is a chance to just say<br>
(I'm in love and you've got me, runaway)<br>
<br>
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it<br>
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets<br>
Your hand forever's all I want<br>
Don't take the money<br>
Don't take the money<br>
<br>
I slept on my own those nights<br>
Was still in my parents' house<br>
And I cut off my t-shirt sleeves<br>
And claim a new continent<br>
'Til I saw your face and hands<br>
Covered in sun and then<br>
I think I understand<br>
Will I understand?<br>
<br>
Will we fight, stay up late?<br>
In my dreams I'm to blame<br>
Different sides of the bed<br>
Roll your eyes, shake my head<br>
Now we're stuck in the storm<br>
We were born to ignore<br>
And all I got is a chance to just say<br>
(I'm in love and you've got me, runaway)<br>
<br>
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it<br>
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets<br>
Your hand forever's all I want<br>
Don't take the money<br>
Don't take the money<br>
(I'm in love and you've got me, runaway)<br>
<br>
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it<br>
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets<br>
Your hand forever's all I want<br>
Don't take the money<br>
Don't take the money<br>
(I'm in love and you've got me, runaway)<br>
<br>
When you're looking at your shadow<br>
Standing on the edge of yourself<br>
Praying on the darkness<br>
Just don't take the money<br>
Dreaming of an easy<br>
Waking up without weight now<br>
And you're looking at the heartless<br>
Just don't take the money<br>
<br>
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it<br>
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets<br>
Your hand forever's all I want<br>
Don't take the money<br>
Well, don't take the money<br>
(I'm in love and you've got me, runaway)<br>
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it<br>
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets<br>
Your hand forever's all I want<br>
Don't take the money<br>
Don't take the money<br>
Just don't take the money<br>
Just don't take the money<br>
Just don't take the money<br>
Just don't take the money<br>
