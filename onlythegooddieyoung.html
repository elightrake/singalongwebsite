    <h1>ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG – BILLY JOEL – 1977</h1>
    <p>Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait<br>
You Catholic girls start much too late<br>
Aw, but sooner or later it comes down to fate<br>
I might as well will be the one<br>
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray<br>
They built you a temple and locked you away<br>
Aw, but they never told you the price that you pay<br>
For things that you might have done<br>
Well, only the good die young<br>
That's what I said<br>
Only the good die young<br>
Only the good die young<br>
You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd<br>
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud<br>
We might be laughing a bit too loud<br>
Aw, but that never hurt no one<br>
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign<br>
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line<br>
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind<br>
Never let's in the sun<br>
Darlin', only the good die young<br>
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br>
I tell ya only the good die young<br>
Only the good die young<br>
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation<br>
You got a brand new soul<br>
Mmm, and a cross of gold<br>
But, Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information<br>
You didn't count on me<br>
When you were counting on your rosary<br>
Oh-whoa-whoa<br>
And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait<br>
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't<br>
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints<br>
The sinners are much more fun<br>
You know that only the good die young, oh, baby<br>
I tell ya only the good die young<br>
Only the good die young<br>
Said your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation<br>
Aw, she never cared for me<br>
But did she ever say a prayer for me?<br>
Oh-whoa-whoa<br>
Come out, come out, come out, Virginia, don't let me wait<br>
You Catholic girls start much too late<br>
Sooner or later it comes down to fate<br>
I might as well will be the one<br>
You know that only the good die young<br>
Tell you, baby<br>
You know that only the good die young<br>
Only the good die young<br>
Only the good<br>
Only the good die young<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-hoo<br>
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-hoo<br>
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-hoo<br>
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo<br>
Only the good die young<br>
Only the good die young<br>
