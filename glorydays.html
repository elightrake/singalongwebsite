    <h1>GLORY DAYS – BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN – 1984</h1>
    <p>I had a friend was a big baseball player<br>
Back in high school<br>
He could throw that speedball by you<br>
Make you look like a fool boy<br>
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar<br>
I was walking in, he was walking out<br>
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks<br>
But all he kept talking about was<br>
<br>
Glory days well they'll pass you by<br>
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye<br>
Glory days, glory days<br>
<br>
Well, there's a girl that lives up the block<br>
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads<br>
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by<br>
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed<br>
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up<br>
I guess it's two years gone by now<br>
We just sit around talking about the old times<br>
She says when she feels like crying<br>
She starts laughing thinking about<br>
<br>
Glory days well they'll pass you by<br>
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye<br>
Glory days, glory days<br>
<br>
Think I'm going down to the well tonight<br>
And I'm going to drink 'til I get my fill<br>
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it<br>
But I probably will<br>
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture<br>
A little of the glory of, well time slips away<br>
And leaves you with nothing mister but<br>
Boring stories of<br>
<br>
Glory days yeah they'll pass you by<br>
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye<br>
Glory days, glory days<br>
Yeah, they'll pass you by<br>
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye<br>
Glory days, glory days!<br>
