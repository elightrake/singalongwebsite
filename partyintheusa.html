    <h1>PARTY IN THE U.S.A. – MILEY CYRUS – 2009</h1>
    <p>I hopped off the plane at LAX<br>
With a dream and my cardigan<br>
Welcome to the land of fame excess (woah)<br>
Am I gonna fit in?<br>
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time<br>
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign<br>
This is all so crazy<br>
Everybody seems so famous<br>
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick<br>
Too much pressure and I'm nervous<br>
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio<br>
And a Jay-Z song was on<br>
And a Jay-Z song was on<br>
And a Jay-Z song was on<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah<br>
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song<br>
They know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
Get to the club in my taxi cab<br>
Everybody's looking at me now<br>
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?<br>
She gotta be from out of town"<br>
So hard with my girls not around me<br>
It's definitely not a Nashville party<br>
'Cause all I see are stilettos<br>
I guess I never got the memo<br>
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick<br>
Too much pressure and I'm nervous<br>
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah<br>
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song<br>
They know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)<br>
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)<br>
Something stops me every time (every time)<br>
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah (noddin' my head)<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah (ooh, yeah)<br>
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song<br>
They know I'm gonna be okay (gonna be okay)<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away (flying away)<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah (noddin' my head like, yeah)<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah (movin' my hips like, yeah)<br>
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song<br>
They know I'm gonna be okay (I'm gonna be okay)<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
Yeah (ha-ha-ha-ha), it's a party in the U.S.A.<br>
