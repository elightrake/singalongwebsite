    <h1>SANTERIA – SUBLIME – 1997</h1>
    <p>I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball<br>
Well, I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spend it all<br>
If I could find that Heina and that Sancho that she's found<br>
Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down<br>
<br>
What I really want to know<br>
Ah, baby, mm<br>
What I really want to say<br>
I can't define<br>
Well it's love that I need<br>
<br>
Oh, my soul will have to wait 'til I get back and find<br>
Heina of my own<br>
Daddy's gonna love one and all<br>
I feel the break, feel the break<br>
Feel the break and I got to live it up, oh yeah huh<br>
Well, I swear that I, well I really want to know<br>
<br>
Ah, baby, what I really want to say, I can't define<br>
That love, make it go, my soul will have to<br>
Ooh, what I really want to say, ah baby<br>
What I really want to say, is I've got mine<br>
<br>
And I'll make it, yes, I'm going up<br>
Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him<br>
He best go run and hide<br>
Daddy's got a new .45<br>
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat<br>
Believe me when I say that I got something for his punk ass<br>
<br>
What I really want know, my baby<br>
Ooh, what I really want to say is there's just one way back<br>
And I'll make it, yeah, my soul will have to wait<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
