    <h1>SUMMER OF ’69 – BRYAN ADAMS – 1984</h1>
    <p>I got my first real six-string<br>
Bought it at the five and dime<br>
Played it 'til my fingers bled<br>
Was the summer of '69<br>
Me and some guys from school<br>
Had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit and Jody got married<br>
I should've known we'd never get far<br>
Oh, when I look back now<br>
That summer seemed to last forever<br>
And if I had the choice<br>
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there<br>
Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complainin'<br>
When you got a job to do<br>
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in<br>
And that's when I met you, yeah!<br>
<br>
Standin' on your mama's porch<br>
You told me that you'd wait forever<br>
Oh, and when you held my hand<br>
I knew that it was now or never<br>
Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah<br>
Back in the summer of '69, oh<br>
<br>
Man, we were killin' time<br>
We were young and restless<br>
We needed to unwind<br>
I guess nothing can last forever<br>
Forever, no<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
And now the times are changin'<br>
Look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string<br>
I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
Standin' on your mama's porch<br>
You told me that it'd last forever<br>
Oh, and when you held my hand<br>
I knew that it was now or never<br>
Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah<br>
Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah<br>
Me and my baby in '69, oh, oh<br>
It was the summer, summer, summer of '69<br>
<br>
