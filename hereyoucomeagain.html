    <h1>HERE YOU COME AGAIN – DOLLY – 1977</h1>
    <p>Here you come again<br>
Just when I've begun to get myself together<br>
You waltz right in the door, just like you've done before<br>
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger<br>
<br>
Here you come again<br>
Just when I'm about to make it work without you<br>
You look into my eyes and light those dreamy eyes<br>
And pretty soon I'm wondering how I came to doubt you<br>
<br>
All you gotta do is smile that smile<br>
And there go all my defenses<br>
Just leave it up to you and in a little while<br>
You're messing up my mind and filling up my senses<br>
<br>
Here you come again<br>
Looking better than a body has a right to<br>
And shaking me up so, that all I really know<br>
Is here you come again, and here I go<br>
<br>
All you gotta do is smile that smile<br>
And there go all my defenses<br>
Just leave it up to you and in a little while<br>
You're messing up my mind and filling up my senses<br>
<br>
Here you come again<br>
Looking better than a body has a right to<br>
And shaking me up so, that all I really know<br>
Is here you come again, and here I go<br>
<br>
Here I go<br>
And here I go<br>
And here I go<br>
Here you come again<br>
And here I go<br>
Here I go<br>
And here I go<br>
