    <h1>THE WEIGHT – THE BAND – 1968</h1>
    <p>I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead<br>
        I just need some place where I can lay my head<br>
        "Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"<br>
        He just grinned and shook my hand, "no" was all he said<br>
        <br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        Take a load for free<br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        And (and, and) you put the load right on me<br>
        (You put the load right on me)<br>
        <br>
        I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide<br>
        When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side<br>
        I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on let's go downtown."<br>
        She said, "I gotta go but my friend can stick around."<br>
        <br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        Take a load for free<br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        And (and, and) you put the load right on me<br>
        (You put the load right on me)<br>
        <br>
        Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say<br>
        It's just old Luke and Luke's waitin' on the Judgment Day<br>
        "Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"<br>
        He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"<br>
        <br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        Take a load for free<br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        And (and, and) you put the load right on me<br>
        (You put the load right on me)<br>
        <br>
        Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog<br>
        He said, "I will fix your rack if you take Jack, my dog."<br>
        I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."<br>
        He said, "That's OK, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"<br>
        <br>
        Yeah, take a load off Fanny<br>
        Take a load for free<br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        And (and, and) you put the load right on me<br>
        (You put the load right on me)<br>
        <br>
        Catch a cannon ball now to take me down the line<br>
        My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time<br>
        To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one<br>
        Who sent me here with her regards for everyone<br>
        <br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        Take a load for free<br>
        Take a load off Fanny<br>
        And (and, and) you put the load right on me<br>
        (You put the load right on me)<br></p>
