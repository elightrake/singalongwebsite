    <h1>ME AND JULIO DOWN BY THE SCHOOLYARD – PAUL SIMON – 1972</h1>
    <p>The mama pajama rolled out of bed<br>
        And she ran to the police station<br>
        When the papa found out he began to shout<br>
        And he started the investigation<br>
        It's against the law<br>
        It was against the law<br>
        What the mama saw<br>
        It was against the law<br>
        <br>
        The mama looked down and spit on the ground<br>
        Every time my name gets mentioned<br>
        The papa said, "Oy, if I get that boy<br>
        I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"<br>
        <br>
        Well I'm on my way<br>
        I don't know where I'm going<br>
        I'm on my way<br>
        I'm taking my time<br>
        But I don't know where<br>
        Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona<br>
        Seein' me and Julio<br>
        Down by the schoolyard<br>
        Seein' me and Julio<br>
        Down by the schoolyard<br>
        <br>
        Whoa, in a couple of days they come and take me away<br>
        But the press let the story leak<br>
        And when the radical priest<br>
        Come to get me released<br>
        We was all on the cover of Newsweek<br>
        <br>
        And I'm on my way<br>
        I don't know where I'm going<br>
        I'm on my way<br>
        I'm taking my time<br>
        But I don't know where<br>
        Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona<br>
        Seein' me and Julio<br>
        Down by the schoolyard<br>
        Seein' me and Julio<br>
        Down by the schoolyard<br>
        Seein' me and Julio<br>
        Down by the schoolyard<br></p>
