    <h1>LIDO SHUFFLE – BOZ SCAGGS – 1976</h1>
    <p>Lido missed the boat that day, he left the shack<br>
But that was all he missed, and he ain't comin' back<br>
At a tombstone bar in a juke joint car, he made a stop<br>
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top<br>
<br>
Next stop, Chi-town, Lido put the money down, let it roll<br>
He said, "One more job oughta get it<br>
One last shot 'fore we quit it<br>
One for the road"<br>
<br>
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh<br>
He's for the money, he's for the show<br>
Lido's a-waiting for the go<br>
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
He said, "One more job oughta get it<br>
One last shot 'fore we quit it<br>
One more for the road"<br>
<br>
Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun until he got the note<br>
Saying, "Toe the line or blow it, " and that was all she wrote<br>
He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the borderline, goin' for broke<br>
Sayin', "One more hit oughta do it<br>
This joint, ain't nothin' to it<br>
One more for the road"<br>
<br>
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh<br>
He's for the money, he's for the show<br>
Lido's a-waiting for the go<br>
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh<br>
"One more job oughta get it<br>
One last shot, then we quit it<br>
One more for the road"<br>
<br>
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh<br>
He's for the money, he's for the show<br>
Lido's a-waiting for the go<br>
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
"One more job oughta get it"<br></p>
