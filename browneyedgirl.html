    <h1>BROWN EYED GIRL – VAN MORRISON – 1967</h1>
    <p>Hey, where did we go?<br>
        Days when the rains came<br>
        Down in the hollow<br>
        Playin' a new game<br>
        Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey<br>
        Skippin' and a-jumpin'<br>
        In the misty morning fog with<br>
        Our, our hearts a-thumping and you<br>
        My brown-eyed girl<br>
        And you, my brown-eyed girl<br>
        And whatever happened<br>
        To Tuesday and so slow?<br>
        Going down the old mine with a<br>
        Transistor radio<br>
        Standing in the sunlight laughing<br>
        Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall<br>
        Slipping and sliding<br>
        All along the waterfall with you<br>
        My brown-eyed girl<br>
        You, my brown-eyed girl<br>
        Do you remember when we used to sing?<br>
        Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da<br>
        Just like that<br>
        Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da, la-tee-da<br>
        So hard to find my way<br>
        Now that I'm all on my own<br>
        I saw you just the other day<br>
        My, how you have grown<br>
        Cast my memory back there, Lord<br>
        Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout it<br>
        Making love in the green grass<br>
        Behind the stadium with you<br>
        My brown-eyed girl<br>
        You, my brown-eyed girl<br>
        Do you remember when we used to sing?<br>
        Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da<br>
        Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da</p>
