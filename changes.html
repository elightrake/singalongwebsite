    <h1>CHANGES – BOWIE – 1971
    </h1>
    <p>Oh, yeah<br>
        Mmm<br>
        Still don't know what I was waitin' for<br>
        And my time was runnin' wild<br>
        A million dead end streets and<br>
        Every time I thought I'd got it made<br>
        It seemed the taste was not so sweet<br>
        So I turned myself to face me<br>
        But I've never caught a glimpse<br>
        How the others must see the faker<br>
        I'm much too fast to take that test<br>
        <br>
        Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes<br>
        Turn and face the strange<br>
        Ch-ch-changes<br>
        Don't want to be a richer man<br>
        Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes<br>
        Turn and face the strange<br>
        Ch-ch-changes<br>
        There's gonna have to be a different man<br>
        Time may change me<br>
        But I can't trace time<br>
        <br>
        Mmm, yeah<br>
        I watch the ripples change their size<br>
        But never leave the stream<br>
        Of warm impermanence<br>
        And so the days float through my eyes<br>
        But still the days seem the same<br>
        And these children that you spit on<br>
        As they try to change their worlds<br>
        Are immune to your consultations<br>
        They're quite aware of what they're goin' through<br>
        <br>
        Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes<br>
        Turn and face the strange<br>
        Ch-ch-changes<br>
        Don't tell them to grow up and out of it<br>
        Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes<br>
        Turn and face the strange<br>
        Ch-ch-changes<br>
        Where's your shame?<br>
        You've left us up to our necks in it<br>
        Time may change me<br>
        But you can't trace time<br>
        Strange fascinations fascinate me<br>
        Ah, changes are taking<br>
        The pace I'm goin' through<br>
        <br>
        Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes<br>
        Turn and face the strange<br>
        Ch-ch-changes<br>
        Ooh, look out, you rock 'n' rollers<br>
        Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes<br>
        Turn and face the strange<br>
        Ch-ch-changes<br>
        Pretty soon now you're gonna get older<br>
        Time may change me<br>
        But I can't trace time<br>
        I said that time may change me<br>
        But I can't trace time</p>
