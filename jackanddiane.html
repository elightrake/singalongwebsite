    <h1>JACK AND DIANE – JOHN MELENCAMP – 1982</h1>
    <p>A little ditty 'bout Jack & Diane<br>
Two American kids growing up in the heart land<br>
Jack, he's gonna be a football star<br>
Diane's debutante, back seat of Jacky's car<br>
Suckin' on chilli dog outside the Tastee Freez<br>
Diane sitting on Jacky's lap<br>
Got his hands between her knees<br>
<br>
Jack he says<br>
"Hey, Diane, let's run off behind a shady tree<br>
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks<br>
Let me do what I please"<br>
<br>
Saying "Oh yeah<br>
Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone"<br>
Saying "Oh yeah<br>
Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone"<br>
They walk on<br>
<br>
Jack he sits back, collects his thoughts for a moment<br>
Scratches his head, and does his best James Dean<br>
"Well then, there, Diane, we ought to run off to the city"<br>
Diane says<br>
"Baby, you ain't missing nothing"<br>
But Jack he says, yeah<br>
<br>
"Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone"<br>
"Oh yeah"<br>
He's saying "Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone"<br>
<br>
Oh, let it rock, let it roll<br>
Let the bible belt come and save my soul<br>
Holdin' on to sixteen as long as you can<br>
Change is coming 'round real soon<br>
Make us women and men<br>
"Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone"<br>
"Oh yeah"<br>
He's saying "Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone"<br>
A little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane<br>
Two American kids doin' the best they can<br>
