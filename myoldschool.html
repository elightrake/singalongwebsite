    <h1>MY OLD SCHOOL – STEELY DAN – 1973</h1>
    <p>I remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes<br>
        When you put me on the Wolverine up to Annandale<br>
        It was still September<br>
        When your daddy was quite surprised<br>
        To find you with the working girls in the county jail<br>
        I was smoking with the boys upstairs when I<br>
        Heard about the whole affair, I said oh no<br>
        William and Mary won't do<br>
        Well, I did not think the girl<br>
        Could be so cruel<br>
        And I'm never going back<br>
        To my old school<br>
        <br>
        Oleanders growing outside her door<br>
        Soon they're gonna be in bloom up in Annandale<br>
        I can't stand her<br>
        Doing what she did before<br>
        Living like a gypsy queen in a fairy tale<br>
        Well, I hear the whistle but I can't go, I'm gonna<br>
        Take her down to Mexico, she said oh no<br>
        Guadalajara won't do<br>
        Well, I did not think the girl<br>
        Could be so cruel<br>
        And I'm never going back<br>
        To my old school<br>
        <br>
        California tumbles into the sea<br>
        That'll be the day I go back to Annandale<br>
        Tried to warn you<br>
        About Chino and Daddy Gee<br>
        But I can't seem to get to you through the U.S. Mail<br>
        Well I hear the whistle but I can't go, I'm gonna<br>
        Take her down to Mexico, she said oh no<br>
        Guadalajara won't do<br>
        Well, I did not think the girl<br>
        Could be so cruel<br>
        And I'm never going back<br>
        To my old school<br></p>
