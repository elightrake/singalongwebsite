    <h1>RASPBERRY BERET – PRINCE – 1985</h1>
    <p>One, two<br>
One, two, three, uh<br>
Yeah<br>
I was working part time in a five-and-dime<br>
My boss was Mr. McGee<br>
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind<br>
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely<br>
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing<br>
But different than the day before<br>
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her<br>
She walked in through the out door, out door<br>
She wore a<br>
<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
The kind you find in a second hand store<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
I think I love her<br>
<br>
Built like she was<br>
She had the nerve to ask me<br>
If I planned to do her any harm<br>
So, look here<br>
I put her on the back of my bike<br>
And-a we went riding<br>
Down by old man Johnson's farm<br>
<br>
I said now, overcast days never turned me on<br>
But something about the clouds and her mixed<br>
She wasn't too bright<br>
But I could tell when she kissed me<br>
She knew how to get her kicks<br>
<br>
She wore a<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
The kind you find in a second hand store<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
I think I love her<br>
<br>
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof<br>
And the horses wonder who you are<br>
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees<br>
Makes you feel like a movie star<br>
<br>
Listen<br>
They say the first time ain't the greatest<br>
But I tell ya<br>
If I had the chance to do it all again<br>
I wouldn't change a stroke<br>
'Cause baby, I'm the most<br>
With a girl as fine as she was then, oh, oh yeah<br>
<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
The kind you find in a second hand store <br>
Raspberry beret<br>
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
I think I, I think I, I think I love her<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
(No, no, no)<br>
The kind you find in a second hand store (no, no, no)<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
(Tell me where have all the raspberry women gone?)<br>
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more<br>
Raspberry beret<br>
