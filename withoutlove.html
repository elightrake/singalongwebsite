    <h1>WITHOUT LOVE – HAIRSPRAY – 2007</h1>
    <p>Once I was a selfish fool<br>
Who never understood<br>
Never looked inside myself<br>
Though on the outside, I looked good<br>
Then we met and you made me<br>
The man I am today<br>
Tracy, I'm in love with you<br>
No matter what you weigh<br>
'Cause without love<br>
Life is like the seasons with no summer<br>
Without love<br>
Life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer<br>
Tracy, I'll be yours forever<br>
'Cause I never wanna be<br>
Without love<br>
Tracy, never set me free<br>
No, I ain't lying<br>
Never set me free, Tracy, no, no, no<br>
Living in the ghetto<br>
Black is everywhere you go<br>
Who'd have thought I'd love a girl<br>
Whose skin was white as winter snow?<br>
In my ivory tower<br>
Life was just a hostess snack<br>
But now I've tasted chocolate<br>
And I'm never going back<br>
'Cause without love<br>
Life is like a beat that you can't follow<br>
Without love<br>
Life is Doris Day at The Apollo<br>
Darling, I'll be yours forever<br>
'Cause I never wanna be without love<br>
So darling, never set me free<br>
No<br>
I'm yours forever<br>
Never set me free, no, no, no<br>
If I'm left without my baby doll<br>
I don't know what I'll do<br>
Link, I've got to break out<br>
So that I can get my hands on you<br>
And girl, if I can't touch you<br>
Then I'm gonna lose control<br>
Seaweed, you're my black white knight<br>
I've found my blue-eyed soul<br>
Sweet freedom is our goal<br>
Trace, I wanna kiss you<br>
Let me out at the next toll<br>
Without love<br>
Life is like a prom that won't invite us<br>
Without love<br>
It's like getting my big break and laryngitis<br>
Without love<br>
Life's a '45 when you can't buy it<br>
Without love<br>
Life is like my mother on a diet<br>
Like a week that's only Mondays<br>
Only ice cream, never sundaes<br>
Like a circle with no center<br>
Like a door marked 'Do Not Enter'<br>
Darling, I'll be yours forever<br>
'Cause I never wanna be<br>
Without love<br>
Yes, now you've captured me<br>
Without love<br>
I surrender happily<br>
Without love<br>
Oh, Seaweed never set me free, no, no, no, I ain't lying<br>
Never set me free, no, no, no<br>
No, I don't wanna live without love, love, love<br>
Darling, you had best believe me<br>
Never leave me without love<br>
