    <h1>EVERYDAY I WRITE THE BOOK – ELVIS COSTELLO & THE ATTRACTIONS – 1983</h1>
    <p>Don't tell me you don't know what love is<br>
When you're old enough to know better<br>
When you find strange hands in your sweater<br>
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote<br>
I'm a man with a mission on two or three editions<br>
<br>
And I'm giving you a longing look<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday I write the book<br>
<br>
Chapter One: We didn't really get along<br>
Chapter Two: I think I fell in love with you<br>
You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three<br>
But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four<br>
Five and Six.<br>
<br>
And I'm giving you a longing look<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday I write the book<br>
<br>
The way you walk<br>
The way you talk and try to kiss me<br>
And laugh in four or five paragraphs.<br>
All your compliments and your cutting remarks<br>
Are captured here in my quotation marks.<br>
<br>
And I'm giving you a longing look<br>
Everyday <br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday I write the book<br>
<br>
Don't tell me you don't know the difference<br>
Between a lover and a fighter<br>
With my pen and my electric typewriter<br>
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal<br>
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.<br>
And I'm giving you a longing look<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday I write the book<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday<br>
Everyday I write the book<br>
