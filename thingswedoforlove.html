    <h1>THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE – 10CC – 1977</h1>
    <p>Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river<br>
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea<br>
You lay your bets and then you pay the price<br>
The things we do for love, the things we do for love<br>
<br>
Communication is the problem to the answer<br>
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone<br>
The weather's turned and all the lines are down<br>
The things we do for love, the things we do for love<br>
<br>
Like walking in the rain and the snow<br>
When there's nowhere to go<br>
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying<br>
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes<br>
You think you're gonna break up<br>
Then she says she wants to make up<br>
<br>
Ooh you made me love you<br>
Ooh you've got a way<br>
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall<br>
<br>
A compromise would surely help the situation<br>
Agree to disagree but disagree to part<br>
When after all it's just a compromise of<br>
The things we do for love, the things we do for love<br>
<br>
Like walking in the rain and the snow<br>
When there's nowhere to go<br>
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying<br>
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes<br>
You think you're gonna break up<br>
Then she says she wants to make up<br>
<br>
Ooh you made me love you<br>
Ooh you've got a way<br>
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall<br>
