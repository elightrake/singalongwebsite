    <h1>I CAN DO THAT – MARVIN HAMLISCH – 1975</h1>
    <p>I'm watchin' Sis<br>
Go pitterpat.<br>
Said,<br>
"I can do that,<br>
I can do that."<br>
<br>
Knew ev'ry step<br>
Right off the bat.<br>
Said,"I can do that,<br>
I can do that."<br>
<br>
One morning Sis won't go to dance class<br>
I grabbed her shoes and tights and all,<br>
But my foot's too small,<br>
So,I stuff her shoes<br>
With extra socks,<br>
Run seven blocks<br>
In nothin' flat.<br>
Hell,I can do that,<br>
I can do that.<br>
<br>
I got to class<br>
And had it made,<br>
And so I stayed<br>
The rest of my life.<br>
All thanks to Sis<br>
(Now married and fat),<br>
<br>
I can do this.<br>
<br>
That I can do!<br>
I can do that.<br></p>
