    <h1>CRUEL TO BE KIND – NICK LOWE – 1978</h1>
    <p>Oh I can't take another heartache<br>
Though you say you're my friend, I'm at my wit's end<br>
You say your love is bonafide, but that don't coincide<br>
With the things that you do<br>
And when I ask you to be nice, you say<br>
<br>
You've gotta be cruel to be kind, in the right measure<br>
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign<br>
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you, baby<br>
(You've gotta be cruel)<br>
You gotta be cruel to be kind<br>
<br>
Well I do my best to understand dear<br>
But you still mystify and I want to know why<br>
I pick myself up off the ground<br>
To have you knock me back down, again and again<br>
And when I ask you to explain, you say<br>
<br>
You've gotta be cruel to be kind, in the right measure<br>
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign<br>
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you, baby<br>
(You've gotta be cruel)<br>
You gotta be cruel to be kind<br>
<br>
Well I do my best to understand dear<br>
But you still mystify and I want to know why<br>
I pick myself up off the ground<br>
To have you knock me back down, again and again<br>
And when I ask you to explain, you say<br>
<br>
You've gotta be cruel to be kind, in the right measure<br>
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign<br>
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you baby<br>
(You've gotta be cruel)<br>
You gotta be cruel to be kind,<br> 
oh, in the right measure<br>
(Cruel to be kind), it's a very very very good sign<br>
(Cruel to be kind), it means that I love you, baby<br>
(You've gotta be cruel)<br>
You gotta be cruel to be kind<br>
