    <h1>HEAD OVER FEET – ALANIS MORISETTE – 1995</h1>
    <p>I had no choice but to hear you<br>
You stated your case, time and again<br>
I thought about it<br>
You treat me like I'm a princess<br>
I'm not used to liking that<br>
You ask how my day was<br>
<br>
You've already won me over<br>
In spite of me<br>
And don't be alarmed if I fall<br>
Head over feet<br>
And don't be surprised if I love you<br>
For all that you are<br>
I couldn't help it<br>
It's all your fault<br>
<br>
Your love is thick<br>
And it swallowed me whole<br>
You're so much braver<br>
Than I gave you credit for<br>
That's not lip service<br>
<br>
You've already won me over<br>
In spite of me<br>
And don't be alarmed if I fall<br>
Head over feet<br>
And don't be surprised if I love you<br>
For all that you are<br>
I couldn't help it<br>
It's all your fault<br>
<br>
You are the bearer<br>
Of unconditional things<br>
You held your breath<br>
And the door for me<br>
Thanks for your patience<br>
<br>
You're the best listener<br>
That I've ever met<br>
You're my best friend<br>
Best friend with benefits<br>
What took me so long?<br>
I've never felt this healthy before<br>
I've never wanted something rational<br>
I am aware now, oh<br>
I am aware now<br>
<br>
You've already won me over<br>
In spite of me<br>
And don't be alarmed if I fall<br>
Head over feet<br>
And don't be surprised if I love you<br>
For all that you are<br>
I couldn't help it<br>
It's all your fault<br>
