    <h1>IT’S TOO LATE – CAROLE KING – 1971</h1>
    <p>Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time<br>
        There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'<br>
        One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'<br>
        And it's too late, baby, now it's too late<br>
        Though we really did try to make it<br>
        Somethin' inside has died<br>
        And I can't hide and I just can't fake it<br>
        Oh, no, no, no, no, no<br>
        (No, no, no, no)<br>
        It used to be so easy, livin' here with you<br>
        You were light and breezy, and I knew just what to do<br>
        Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool<br>
        And it's too late, baby, now it's too late<br>
        Though we really did try to make it<br>
        Somethin' inside has died<br>
        And I can't hide and I just can't fake it<br>
        Oh, no, no<br>
        There'll be good times again for me and you<br>
        But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too?<br>
        Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you<br>
        But it's too late, baby, now it's too late<br>
        Though we really did try to make it<br>
        Somethin' inside has died<br>
        And I can't hide and I just can't fake it<br>
        Oh, no, no, no, no, no<br>
        It's too late, baby<br>
        It's too late now, darling<br>
        It's too late</p>
